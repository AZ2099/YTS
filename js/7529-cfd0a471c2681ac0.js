Keep in mind that every change you make here will impact every upcoming post as soon as you save your changes.'},{question:"Why can’t I preview how Spintax will generate the final sentences?",answer:"Spintax generates sentences based on the keywords you've added but aren't actually generated until posts are shared. This means you won't be able to preview the finalized writing, so make sure you're happy with the keyword variations you choose. <br class=\"hidden xl:block\" /><br>In the meantime, you’ll see the posts containing brackets and pipes on the calendar view."},{question:"Which post types can I recycle?",answer:'You can recycle all types of content except for YouTube videos and Twitter posts, as this is against their automation rules. <br class="hidden 2xl:block" />While not outlawed, we highly recommend you use Spintax when recycling WordPress posts to avoid potential duplicate content penalties.'},{question:"Can I recycle in bulk?",answer:"Sure! You can recycle multiple posts at once while modifying their posting schedules, individually."}]}},64476:function(e,t,o){o.d(t,{Z:function(){return p}});var a=o(85893),s=o(67294),n=o(45697),i=o.n(n),r=o(61896),l=o(20210);let c=e=>{let{className:t,children:o,onLayoutStart:n,appear:i}=e,r=(0,s.useRef)(null),[l,c]=(0,s.useState)("500");return(0,s.useEffect)(()=>{var e;(null==r?void 0:r.current)&&(c(null==r?void 0:null===(e=r.current)||void 0===e?void 0:e.clientHeight),n())},[r,n]),(0,s.useEffect)(()=>{if(!i){r.current.classList.add("is-hidden");return}r.current.classList.remove("is-hidden")},[i]),(0,a.jsx)("p",{ref:r,style:{maxHeight:"".concat(l,"px")},className:"height-animation ".concat(t),children:o})};c.propTypes={className:i().string,children:i().node.isRequired,appear:i().bool.isRequired,onLayoutStart:i().func},c.defaultProps={className:"",onLayoutStart:()=>{}};var u=o(25935);let h=e=>{let{inquiries:t,className:o,onSelect:n,expandIcon:i,minimizeIcon:r,child:l}=e,[c,u]=(0,s.useState)(t[0].question);return t.map((e,t)=>{let{question:s,answer:h,learnMore:p}=e;return(0,a.jsx)(d,{className:o,question:s,answer:h,learnMore:p,activeQuestion:c,setActiveQuestion:e=>{n&&n(t),u(e)},expandIcon:i,minimizeIcon:r,child:l},t)})};h.propTypes={inquiries:i().arrayOf(i().shape({question:i().oneOfType([i().string,i().object]),answer:i().string})).isRequired,className:i().string,learnMore:i().string,expandIcon:i().object,minimizeIcon:i().object,child:i().object},h.defaultProps={className:"p-10 mb-10 shadowed-border",learnMore:null,expandIcon:(0,a.jsx)(r.Z,{}),minimizeIcon:(0,a.jsx)(l.Z,{}),child:null};let d=e=>{let{className:t,question:o,answer:n,learnMore:i,activeQuestion:r,setActiveQuestion:l,expandIcon:h,minimizeIcon:d,child:p}=e,[y,m]=(0,s.useState)(!1),f=(0,s.useCallback)(e=>{if(e===r){l("");return}l(e)},[r,l]);return(0,s.useEffect)(()=>{m(r===o)},[o,r]),(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsxs)("article",{className:"question-card ".concat(t," ").concat(y&&"is-expanded"),children:[(0,a.jsxs)("div",{className:"question flex w-full justify-between items-center content-center ".concat(!y&&"cursor-pointer"),onClick:()=>f(o),children:[(0,a.jsx)("h3",{className:"mb-0 font-bold select-none",children:o}),y?d:h]}),(0,a.jsx)(c,{className:"answer inline ".concat(y&&"mt-2"),appear:y,children:(0,a.jsxs)("span",{children:[(0,u.ZP)(n)," ",i&&(0,a.jsx)("a",{href:i,children:"Click here"})," ",i&&" to learn more."]})})]}),p&&y&&(0,a.jsx)("div",{className:"block lg:hidden mb-[20px] mt-[20px]",children:p})]})};d.propTypes={question:i().oneOfType([i().string,i().object]).isRequired,answer:i().oneOfType([i().string,i().object]).isRequired,className:i().string,activeQuestion:i().oneOfType([i().string,i().object]),setActiveQuestion:i().func.isRequired},d.defaultProps={className:"",activeQuestion:null};var p=h},48145:function(e,t,o){var a=o(85893),s=o(9008),n=o.n(s);o(67294);var i=o(45697),r=o.n(i);let l=e=>{let{url:t,title:o,description:s,keywords:i,image:r,children:l}=e;return(0,a.jsxs)(n(),{children:[(0,a.jsx)("title",{children:o}),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{name:"description",content:s},"description"),i&&(0,a.jsx)("meta",{name:"keywords",content:i},"keywords"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{property:"og:title",content:o},"og:title"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{property:"og:image",content:r},"og:image"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{property:"og:description",content:s},"og:description"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{property:"og:url",content:t},"og:url"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{property:"twitter:title",content:o},"twitter:title"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{name:"twitter:description",content:s},"twitter:description"),(0,a.jsx)("meta",{name:"twitter:image",content:r},"twitter:image"),(0,a.jsx)("link",{rel:"canonical",href:t}),l]})};l.propTypes={url:r().string.isRequired,title:r().string.isRequired,description:r().string.isRequired,keywords:r().string,image:r().string.isRequired},l.defaultProps={url:"https://publer.io",title:"Publer - Your Social Media Superhero",description:"Schedule your Facebook posts, Instagram posts, TikToks, Tweets, Mastodon posts, LinkedIn updates, Pinterest Pins, Google Business Profile posts, YouTube videos, WordPress articles & Telegram messages with Publer.
